      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy, one-skillet recipe that’s ready in 20 minutes and tastes better than takeout; it’s healthier and not greasy. To save time if you don’t have leftover rice on hand or don’t want to cook a batch, use two pouches of ready-to-serve rice. The shrimp is tender and juicy. I use fresh shrimp but you can use frozen shrimp that’s already been cooked. There’s garlic, ginger, green onions, sesame oil, and soy sauce for layers of flavor while peas, carrots, corn, and bits of egg add texture.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pound medium-large fresh shrimp, cleaned (approximately 15-20 count shrimp)</li>
                <li>1 cup frozen peas and diced carrots blend (I don’t thaw and use straight from the freezer)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup corn (I use frozen straight from the freezer)</li>
                <li>2 to 3 garlic cloves, finely minced or pressed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked rice (I use white, long-grain or brown may be substituted. To save time use two 8.8-ounce pouches cooked and ready-to-serve rice)</li>
                <li>2 to 3 green onions, trimmed and sliced into thin rounds</li>
                <li>3 to 4 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To a large non-stick skillet or wok, add the oils, shrimp, and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. Cooking time will vary based on size of shrimp, don’t overcook. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon (allow oils and cooking juices to remain in skillet) and place shrimp on a plate; set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the peas, carrots, corn, and cook for about 2 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften, stir intermittently.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic, ginger, and cook for 1 minute, stir intermittently.</li>
                <li>Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.</li>
                <li>Add the shrimp, rice, green onions, evenly drizzle with soy sauce, evenly season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until shrimp is reheated through. Recipe is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Reheat gently as desired.</li>
            </ol>
