HTML project for the Odin Project

So far I have learned about semantec HTML and how to code the basic structure of an HTML file. I have also installed Linux via a java VirtualBox machine on my desktop and laptop and I have learned basic commands in the linux command line. Lastly I have set up a github and learned how to operate git via the CLI and through github to use version control for my projects.
